# Dotfiles
The dotfiles of my current Linux install using the DWM window manager. My main computer is currently using Windows for engineering applications, but this is still used on some other devices and parts of these dotfiles are used on a WSL Ubuntu installation.

The master branch is for my Arch Linux install and has been very unchanging for multiple years.

The macos branch includes dotfiles used in a short switch to a virtualized Mac OS operating system. Many elements are still the same.

The latest sway-test branch was used to test out Wayland and the Sway window manager.
